[Volkswagen taps Microsoft's cloud to develop self-driving software](https://driving.ca/volkswagen/auto-news/news/volkswagen-taps-microsofts-cloud-to-develop-self-driving-software)

## My Comments

This article discussed how Volkswagen, an automotive corporation that manufactures brands such as Audi and Lamborghini, is taking steps to streamline the development of self-driving software. Whereas before each brand in the Volkswagen group was developing seperately, they are now consolidated under a subsidiary called Car.Software. This will allow them to collaborate on core features, but work independently on the user-facing end to match their brand identity. Additionally, the subsidiary will also now use Microsoft's cloud platform develop the software, which will allow them to automatically deploy updates straight to cars as development progresses. 

I found this article quite interesting because it demonstrates the increasing competition in the field of autonomous driving. This competition will have positive benefits both in the short term, with improved safety features, and in the long term with fully autonomous driving. In particular, using Microsoft's Azure cloud to push mid-cycle updates is a very important step. This update system is already used by Tesla, who currently dominates the field, to constantly improve their software. More competition from Volkswagen and other corporations in the future will accelerate the progress.
